analysis and price prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning

Data science and machine learning have become essential tools for predicting house prices in real estate, enabling more accurate and data-driven decision-making. The process begins with collecting data from diverse sources such as real estate listings, government records, and economic indicators. Key features like property size, number of rooms, location, and proximity to amenities are analyzed alongside market trends and economic factors. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalizing data, ensures reliability. Machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, are then trained to identify patterns and predict prices. Exploratory data analysis further reveals relationships between features, such as the impact of location on value. This integration of data science streamlines property valuation for buyers, sellers, and investors.

Data Collection

Data is gathered from real estate websites, census data, market trends, and economic reports.
Key features include:
Property-specific: Size, number of rooms, construction year.
Location-based: Neighborhood, proximity to amenities, crime rate.
Economic: Interest rates, GDP, local job markets.
Data Preprocessing

Cleansing the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Normalizing or scaling features for better model performance.
Model Training

Machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks are used to train the system.
Models learn patterns in the data, such as how location or property size influences price.
Testing and Validation

Models are tested on unseen data to evaluate accuracy and reliability.
Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) assess performance.
